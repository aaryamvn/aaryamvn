**Hey, I'm Aaryaman** - a 15-year-old innovator based in Hyderabad, India. I aspire to perfect the emotional connection between my products and their users via thoughtful design and strategic planning. 

I'm have a strong passion for both technology and entrepreneurship. I've had a deep love for startups from a very young age, starting my career off at 8 years old by opening a cloud sandwich restaurant on Uber Eats which eventually led them to add a minimum age clause to their T&C.

Currently, I'm running <a href="https://buildergroop.com">Buildergroop</a>. We're a startup that enables gen-z folks with a passion for building to learn, discuss, ideate, and collaborate. We're collectively establishing the future of innovation and we'd love for you to check us out.
